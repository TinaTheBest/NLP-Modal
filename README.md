Repository Description:

This project focuses on extracting data from a vignette (e.g., information from specific images or files) and inserting it into a CSV file. The data can then be used to populate a database.

The project was developed using a **free Azure student account**, which provides access to cloud services for data processing and analysis. This account was used to host resources necessary for data extraction.

Important: The data used in this project is sensitive and should be handled with care. It is recommended to follow best practices for managing sensitive data and not share real examples without proper consent.
